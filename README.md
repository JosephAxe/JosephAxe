<h1 align="center">JosÃ© Machado</h1>

I'm a software engineer passionate about the world of Data Science and Data Engineering. I have more than 4 years of working experience using different technologies in several contexts, especially Python and AWS. I believe that my development helps in the development of other people. I love to learn new concepts, experience new challenges and pass on all the knowledge to impact other people's lives.

Nowdays, I work in Data Engineering projects, involving data ingestion, operating in a cloud computing environment. In addition, I'm a content creator. I share my learnings and experiences through my YouTube channel and some training projects. I look forward to continuing to evolve my skills with Python and AWS, experimenting with new big data technologies such as Apache Spark and Airflow.
